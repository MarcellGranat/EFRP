\section*{Introduction}
\setcounter{page}{1}

This short paper is about an empirical analysis about cointegration using six stock prices (downloaded from Bloomberg) from 2003 december to 2019 June. Testing cointegration between stocks is a relevant technique to pairs trading, which is a widely used strategy. However pairs trading may be based on several pairs choosing rules, many papers concluded formerly, that cointegration leads to higher profitability on real world data
%\cite{Huck.2014}.
In this study I do not focus on this methods efficiency, only on the frequency of cointegrated stock prices. For this purpose I commit two different cointegration-test (Engel-Granger method and Johansen test) on the full time-interval, after I also use this methods with rolling windows.

\section*{Engle-Granger method}

Engle-Granger method is simple way to test cointegration in bivariate case. Cointegration is diagnosed if the two tested series are integrated in the same order and a linear combination of them exist, which has an integration order of the original non-stationar series minus one %\cite{Kirchgassner.2007}.
The most common is when the tested stock prices are I(1) and their linear combination is stationar.

The used stock prices are presented in figure \ref{fig1}. For a first glance there is a high chance that some cointegrated pairs can be found in this set of series. To commit the tests the first step is to check the time-series integration order. For this purpose I use ADF-test with a significance level 5\%. As a result it is concluded that all the series are I(1), if any of their bivariate linear combination is stationar, then cointegration is diagnosed. The first difference of the stock prices is shown on Figure \label{fig3}.

The second step is run OLS with all the possible pairs and check if there is a series of residuals stationar. Just as at the previous step the stationary test is augmented Dickey-Fuller test without constant or trend component in the auxiliary regression and $\alpha = 5\%$.

With the described parameters \footnote{In my previously mentioned github repository you may find that I wrote an R function to commit the whole Engle-Granger method with specified parameteres. It would be reasonable to see the results with different stationary test or with different significance level (specially if calculating its profitability is also in focus). With the written function, it is possible to modify the test parameters and see how the results change.} the tests confirms only one cointegrated pairs (see Figure \ref{fig4}).
