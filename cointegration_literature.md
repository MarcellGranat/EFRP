*Despite these positive findings, there is reason to believe that cointegration may not be the most appropriate model for pairs trading.* *Companies often experience idiosyncratic shocks that are permanent in nature.* (The reason can be technological change, development of new markets, legal action etc.) Clegg (2014) shows that poverty of being cointegrated is not persistent. This paper introduce the concept of `partial cointegration (PCI)`.

PCI allows the residuals to have a mean-reverting and random walk components. For this modelling there is an R package called [partialAR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/partialAR/index.html).
